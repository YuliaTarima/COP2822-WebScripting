Textbook: Hands-On Project 2-5
Debugging Challenge
In this debugging challenge you will fix mistakes in code for an online calculator.
The code has already been written for you but there are several syntax mistakes 
you will have to locate and correct. You can use your browserâ€™s debugging console 
to assist you in locating the errors. When the code has been fixed, you will be able
to run the online calculator shown in Figure 2-34  in the textbook by clicking 
the calculator buttons and viewing the results in the calculator window.

What was the most enjoyable or challenging part of this assignment?  
Use vocabulary from Chapter 2. (5 sentences minimum)
Please share a new coding concept you learned, how it was used in your coding project, 
and where the concept is explained in the textbook.

Section 2.1 Talks about functions, their naming conventions (JS is case sensitive!),
and difference between the named and anonymous functions, and why anonymous 
functions are important for use with event handlers for when we need to run 
functions or statements to be run in response to the event.

Section 2-2b Events as Object Properties talks about different types of events, 
and in particular "onclick" for event handlers, 
while section 2c talks about "click" for event listeners.

Section 2-2d talks more about events and anonymous functions and how they can 
provide more code flexibility. One of the main points related to our assignment,
is that it's important to provide a reference to the function 
rather than invoking it immediately (Function Reference vs. Function Call).
Function Reference: Providing the function's name without parentheses assigns 
the function itself to the event handler. The function will execute when the event 
is triggered.

Function Call: Including parentheses after the function's name invokes it 
immediately and assigns its return value to the event handler, which is 
typically not the desired behavior.
