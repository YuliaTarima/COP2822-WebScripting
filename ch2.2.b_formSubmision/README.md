Textbook: Hands-On Project 2-2
In this coding project you will create an application that tests whether all fields within a web form have been completed. In creating this application, you will take advantage of the fact that empty text strings are falsy and in a conditional operator will be treated as having the Boolean value false and non-empty strings are treated as truthy with a Boolean value of true. If any of the form fields is left empty, when the Submit Button is clicked, the application will display the alert box shown in Figure 2-31 in the book. Otherwise, when the Submit button is clicked, an alert box with the message “Thank you!” is displayed.
