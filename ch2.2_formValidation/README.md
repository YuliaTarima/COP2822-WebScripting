Textbook: Hands-On Project 2-2
Hands-On Project 2-2

In this coding project you will create an application that tests whether 
all fields within a web form have been completed. 

In creating this application, you will take advantage of the fact 
that empty text strings are falsy and in a conditional operator 
will be treated as having the Boolean value false and non-empty strings 
are treated as truthy with a Boolean value of true. 

If any of the form fields are left empty, when the Submit Button is clicked, 
the application will display the alert box shown in Figure 2-31 in the book. 
Otherwise, when the Submit button is clicked, an alert box with the message 
“Thank you!” is displayed.

What was the most enjoyable or challenging part of this assignment?  
Use vocabulary from Chapter 2. (5 sentences minimum)
Please share a new coding concept you learned, how it was used 
in your coding project, and where the concept is explained in the textbook.

I am a fan of modularity. It not only helps with logically organizing the code,
but also provides for better usability and isolation of issues. In short, 
I prefer not to mix HTML and JavaScript code in the same document. Section 2-2a 
talks about drawback of adding event handlers as HTML attributes is that they 
place JavaScript code within the HTML file. This is why I used an event listener, 
as described in section 2-2b.

2-8a. Talks about working with input control values to retrieve values
from the web form. I had to collect, sanitize, and verify the non-empty and 
also correct values for the form inputs.

2-3. Using Built-in JavaScript Functions talks about the built-in functions
created for our convenience. I used trim() to sanitize and test() of RegExp
to verify the input.

I also challenged myself to use a custom CSS.
