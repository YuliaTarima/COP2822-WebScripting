Textbook: Hands-On Project 2-1
In this project, you will create an application to convert temperature readings between Fahrenheit and Celsius and between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The formula to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to the Celsius scale is

Celsius = (Fahrenheit − 32)/1.8

and the formula to convert a Celsius temperature to the Fahrenheit scale is

Fahrenheit = Celsius × 1.8 + 32

Users will enter a value in a Celsius or Fahrenheit input box, press the Tab key and have the other input box automatically show the temperature reading in the other scale. A preview of the completed page is shown in Figure 2-30. Please use CSS to have your project look as engaging as Figure 2-30 in the textbook.
